Queer Privacy & Building Consensual Systems
-------------------------------------------
by Sarah Jamie Lewis

This is a talk about privacy. Unlike many talks on privacy we won't get into state surveillance, PGP or anonymous browsing.

Instead, I'm going to tell you stories. These stories belong to real people. People trying to live their lives, find love, find comfort and
find happiness in a world that, at best, pretends they don't exist, and at worst, punishes them for existing.

These stories are from people who need privacy and security, but who are failed by our current tool, systems and communities.

Not all of these stories have happy endings, but each one shines a light that can show us how to build tools, systems and communities that
are more useful, more inclusive and safer for those who are marginalized by society.
