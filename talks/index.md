Queer Privacy & Building Consensual Systems
-------------------------------------------
by Sarah Jamie Lewis

This is a talk about privacy. Unlike many talks on privacy we won't get into state surveillance, PGP or anonymous browsing.

Instead, I'm going to tell you stories. These stories belong to real people. People trying to live their lives, find love, find comfort and
find happiness in a world that, at best, pretends they don't exist, and at worst, punishes them for existing.

These stories are from people who need privacy and security, but who are failed by our current tool, systems and communities.

Not all of these stories have happy endings, but each one shines a light that can show us how to build tools, systems and communities that
are more useful, more inclusive and safer for those who are marginalized by society.

Information Flows and Leaks in Social Media
-------------------------------------------
by Vladimir Kropotov and Fyodor Yarochkin

Covfefe or not covfefe? The social network is a very powerful tool of
influence in modern world. Is your opinion really yours? With this
presentation we examine a number of social events and the impact they
had on social media platforms. We try to understand the dynamics of
information dissemination through a social network and demonstrate how
these networks are frequently abused by all sorts of malfactors to
pursue an agenda of their interest. Our findings are presented in form
of several case studies where we walk through series of major events
and analyze how these events were played online. Different regional
groups, different linguistic groups: the behavior on social media
could be a pre-requisite of activity in kinetic world. Known campaigns
of character assassination online were in some cases followed by
physical extermination or attacks on the objects of attention. We
examine such behaviours in different national context: Latin America,
Russia, China, Ukraine and the Middle East and demonstrate the
affiliation of these activities with other Black Market commodities
and services. Further, we discuss how these services could be abused to
have a major impact in physical world.
